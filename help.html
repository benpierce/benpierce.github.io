        <h3>Product Suggestions</h3>
        <p>
            When developing the User Activity Dashboard, we valued simplicity &amp; quality over number of features and believe we have one of the easiest-to-use 
            Apps out there. Of course, products need to evolve and improve, so we're always happy to hear from our customers with any 
            production enhancement ideas.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Although we can't commit to developing every product suggestion, rest assured that we will take each and every suggestion seriously, 
            keep you looped into where it might fit into the roadmap, and communicate upcoming features through this site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Product enhancement suggestions can be sent to <a href="mailto:suggestions@devjitsu.ca">suggestions@devjitsu.ca</a>
