        Solving Real-World Problems, Simply @ DevJitsu
    </p>

    <section>
        <p>
            <b>DevJitsu</b> is made up of a small (<i>very small</i>) group of software developers and engineering leaders who got together to 
            try and solve real-world problems that affect most engineering teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our flagship product, <b>User Activity Dashboard</b>, is a Jira Atlassian app that allows users to easily see what they, and other, colleagues have been 
            working on in Jira. The idea for this app came to one of our engineering leaders one night when one of his teammates was on vacation and 
            it was unclear what that individual had been working on. Jira's built-in timeline feature was helpful, but it didn't go back far enough and it 
            also didn't include key events like issues being <i>reopened</i>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            With the <b>User Activity Dashboard</b>, we hope to solve a number of such real world collaboration challenges, while providing users a 
            simplified, yet powerful, interface in order to ensure that you get the answers you need right away. We're just getting started and highly 
            encourage our customers to reach out with product or feature suggestions so that we can continue to evolve in our mission to <b>Solve real-world problems, simply</b>.
